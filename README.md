## Govwiki

Render a Github wiki using Govuk frontend.

The files in this repository can be copied into a Github wiki repo (https://github.com/username/repo[.wiki].git) and the result pushed to Heroku to create a Govuk-styled rendering of the wiki content.

If you need to password-protect the content (for example if you're not currently working in the open) you can set the environment variables `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` in the Heroku config vars section.

Forks and pull requests welcome.
